Getting and Cleaning Data
This is my work -given limited time- to the course project

The Repo contains the follwoing files 
* run_analysis.R this is the file that contains my code with comments
* subjectsacts.txt, this is the file contains the mean of subject activities (the file that was also sumitted to coursera)
* mean_std_measurements.txt , this file only contains measurements related to Standard Deviation and Means. 
* These are also availabe in the data folder. 

* Note: there was a problem in pushing data and files to git hub, this is why it the date of this commit is 1.5 hour after the due time
